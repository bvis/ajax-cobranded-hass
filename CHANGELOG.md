All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.6.1] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- Media Browser integration: browse captured photos per device via HA Media Browser (Ajax Security Photos)
- Photo gallery with thumbnails, sorted newest first, photo count per device

### Fixed
- Logbook startup error (`async_describe_events` not found) resolved

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- **Photo on Demand**: working photo capture with URL retrieval via NotificationLogService media stream
- Photo storage to `/media/ajax_photos/{device}/` with timestamp overlay (date/time burned into image)
- Configurable photo retention: days (1-365, default 30) and max photos per device (0-10000, default 100)
- Photo persistence across HA restarts (last photo saved to disk per device)
- Automatic photo cleanup on startup and every 24 hours
- Photos browsable via HA Media Browser (Local media → ajax_photos)

### Changed
- Device model identifier changed from "Home Assistant" to Android model for better server compatibility
- Camera entity no longer auto-triggers captures — use the button entity for on-demand photos
- Photo capture button only shown on MotionCam PhOD models (not regular MotionCam)
- Notification ID filtering now matches by device ID for correct multi-camera support
- `DELIVERED_WAS_ALREADY_PERFORMED` response treated as success in photo capture

### Fixed
- Security API errors (arm/disarm rejected) now show proper error messages instead of HTTP 500

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- Force arm services (`ajax_cobranded.force_arm`, `ajax_cobranded.force_arm_night`) to arm ignoring open sensors
- Event platform for FCM push notification events (alarm, arm/disarm, tamper, panic, fire, flood, motion, and more)
- Logbook integration with human-readable security event descriptions and icons
- Glass break binary sensor for GlassProtect and CombiProtect devices
- Vibration binary sensor for DoorProtect Plus devices
- MDI icons for all entity types (`icons.json`)

### Changed
- Event parsing uses compiled protobuf definitions from the official Ajax app for accurate event identification
- Push notifications now fire HA events in addition to triggering coordinator refresh
- Tamper sensor renamed to "Case tamper" and problem sensor to "Device problem" for clarity
- Photo capture button now only shown on MotionCam PhOD models (not regular MotionCam)

### Fixed
- Security API errors (arm/disarm rejected) now show proper error messages instead of HTTP 500
- CI workflow now uses explicit `permissions: contents: read` (resolved 7 CodeQL alerts)
- Proto files excluded from coverage calculation to prevent false coverage drops

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- IMEI sensor for hub cellular modem identifier
- 11 new language translations (Ukrainian, Polish, German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Turkish, Romanian, Czech, Brazilian Portuguese) — total 14 languages
- Example automations (21) for alerts, auto-arm, battery monitoring, and more
- Example Lovelace security dashboard (6-section panel)

### Changed
- GSM type sensor now shows text (2G/3G/4G) instead of raw number
- Removed redundant SIM status sensor (already covered by Cellular connected)

### Fixed
- SIM data now fetched on first refresh (entities created at setup)
- SIM sensors no longer use numeric state_class (string values)

### Security
- Automatic migration of legacy plaintext passwords to SHA-256 hash
- Photo URL domain validation prevents SSRF (only `*.ajax.systems` accepted)
- FCM credentials added to diagnostics redaction set
- Email removed from debug log messages
- Narrowed exception catch from BaseException to Exception
- Internal design docs removed from public repository

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added
- Diagnostics platform for troubleshooting (redacts sensitive data)
- Per-device connectivity binary sensor (online/offline)
- Per-device problem binary sensor (malfunctions detected)
- Hub sensors: GSM type, cellular connected, CRA monitoring, lid tamper
- 46 device type mappings (glass, combi, sirens, REX, transmitters, and more)
- Photo on-demand capture button entity for MotionCam devices
- Status parsing for 30+ device status fields
- Motion detection timestamp (`detected_at`) as attribute
- Disclaimer and legal notice in documentation

### Changed
- FCM credentials now provided by user in options flow (not hardcoded)
- Push notifications are optional — integration works without FCM config
- Hub device no longer duplicated (alarm panel shares device with hub sensors)
- Polling interval defaults to 300s (stream handles real-time)

### Fixed
- `via_device` references corrected across all entity platforms
- Security: removed sensitive data from debug logs
- Security: FCM API key no longer in source code

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added
- Real-time device updates via persistent gRPC stream
- Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) push notifications
- Device registry support with hub-peripheral hierarchy
- Entity categories and translation-based naming
- runtime_data pattern (modern HA)

### Fixed
- Config flow space selection (SelectSelector)
- Config flow login timeout (30s)
- gRPC proto version compatibility with HA's grpcio 1.78.0

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- Initial release
- Alarm control panel (arm/disarm/night mode/group arming with PIN)
- Binary sensors (door, motion, smoke, CO, heat, leak, tamper)
- Diagnostic sensors (battery, temperature, humidity, CO2, signal)
- Switches and lights for relays and dimmers
- Config flow with 2FA, co-branded app label, space selection
- Translations: English, Spanish, Catalan
- gRPC client with retry/backoff, rate limiting, session refresh
