and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added
- Diagnostics platform for troubleshooting (redacts sensitive data)
- Per-device connectivity binary sensor (online/offline)
- Per-device problem binary sensor (malfunctions detected)
- Hub sensors: GSM type, cellular connected, CRA monitoring, lid tamper
- 46 device type mappings (glass, combi, sirens, REX, transmitters, and more)
- Photo on-demand capture button entity for MotionCam devices
- Status parsing for 30+ device status fields
- Motion detection timestamp (`detected_at`) as attribute
- Disclaimer and legal notice in documentation

### Changed
- FCM credentials now provided by user in options flow (not hardcoded)
- Push notifications are optional — integration works without FCM config
- Hub device no longer duplicated (alarm panel shares device with hub sensors)
- Polling interval defaults to 300s (stream handles real-time)

### Fixed
- `via_device` references corrected across all entity platforms
- Security: removed sensitive data from debug logs
- Security: FCM API key no longer in source code

### Security
